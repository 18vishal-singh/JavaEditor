# JavaEditor
This is a simple java Editory (IDE), which will compile and run the java code.

There are many IDE present in market....like Eclipse, NetBeans, but i am not comparing my IDE to them. It is just a simple IDE which will compile and run the java code.

This can be used as project in school or college.
